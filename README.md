## About

Orbit is an explorer for the Verto Protocol. It allows users to track the current trading posts and various statistics for each. Because all trades are made using confirmation transactions on Arweave, they can be linked and shown in a way that is understandable and visualizable, without needing to go through transactions on a block explorer manually.

For users, this makes tracking swaps easy. For developers, this makes monitoring and debugging trading post infrastructure easy.

## Getting Started

First, install necessary dependencies with `yarn`:

```bash
yarn
```

Second, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
